  abstract = {One of the well-known methods to share active and reactive power in microgrids (MGs) is droop control. A disadvantage of this method is that in steady state the frequency of the MG deviates from the nominal value and has to be restored using a secondary control system (SCS). The signal obtained at the output of the SCS is transmitted using a communication channel to the generation sources in the MG, correcting the frequency. However, communication channels are prone to time delays, which should be considered in the design of the SCS; otherwise, the operation of the MG could be compromised. In this paper, two new SCSs control schemes are discussed to deal with this issue: (1) a model predictive controller (MPC); and (2) a Smith predictor-based controller. The performance of both control methodologies are compared with that obtained using a conventional proportional integral-based SCS using simulation work. Stability analysis based on small signal models and participation factors is also realized. It is concluded that in terms of robustness, the MPC has better performance.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a hierarchical transactive energy management framework for a residential microgrid to share excess energy of prosumers with neighbors. A three-level hierarchical structure is proposed in this paper which facilitates energy management in different houses, energy sharing and transactions among neighbors and with the grid. The priority of sharing energy among different houses in a microgrid as well as with the grid is set in such a way that the houses, which have their own generation, will first fulfill their own demand. The power sharing among different houses demonstrates that there are some savings in electricity for a certain period. A generalized cost-benefit analysis framework has been developed by considering different tariff structures (flat rate and feed-in tariff) to assess the financial benefits of patrons to be involved in energy sharing projects. Results from the analysis demonstrate that with the ever decreasing feed-in tariff in Australia, not only the prosumers but the residents without renewable energy sources and energy storage systems can be benefitted through the proposed transactive energy management scheme.},

  abstract = {The implementation of renewable energy sources (RES) in isolated power systems, as is the case of islands, constitutes both a challenge and an opportunity. The intermittency of some RES, namely wind and solar, originates problems of grid stability and a mismatch between power demand and supply. The interconnection between isolated power systems can decrease the RES variability and, thereby, minimize the problems associated with their intermittency. In this work, the endogenous resources of the islands of Pico and Faial, in Azores, were characterized and their power systems modelled. A scenario considering the interconnection between the power systems of the two islands is proposed with the objective of increasing the share of RES power in the total power production. The scenario was modelled using EnergyPLAN and the results show that RES penetration can increase 50 percentage points by 2030 in relation to the current situation. The implementation of this scenario requires additional annual costs of about 1.29 MV. Additionally, based on the knowledge gained from this study, measures that may lead, in the long run, to the complete elimination of the overall use of fossil fuels in both islands are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Lack of inertia in distributed power generation systems (which include renewable energy resources) makes the frequency control problem more time critical. In such situations, the power management system should react to any unbalance of power generation and consumption considerably faster than traditional interconnected power networks. To do this, one of the generation units should be set as the master of frequency in the microgrid, while others should follow the master. The challenge is to find the best master node. In this paper, we propose a metric to rank all generation sources according to their impact on the stability of frequency in the microgrid. The metric is achieved using perturbation analysis of the dominant eigenvalue of the state matrix of the microgrid. It is easily computed and computationally cost effective for microgrids with large number of small resources. Simulation results support the accuracy of this measure in finding a good master node in microgrid. The proposed metric outperforms heuristics such as taking the master node based on degree, closeness or betweenness centrality measures.},

In this work, we use two popular simulation environments – MATLAB/Simulink and NS-3. We extend the synchronization at pre-determined step method by devising a mediator which maintains an efficient integration between two different simulation environments. This mediator supports to mitigate the widely recognized issues of time accumulation errors, the impact of pack loss and long simulation time.

First, model-based controllers are designed using the Lyapunov theory and dynamics of the inverter-based DGs. ANNs are then utilized to approximate these dynamics, resulting in an intelligent controller, which does not require a priori information about DG parameters. Also, the proposed controllers do not require the use of voltage and current proportional-integral controllers normally found in the literature. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers are verified through simulations under different scenarios on an MMG test system. Using Lyapunov analysis, it is proved that the tracking error and the neural network weights are uniformly ultimately bounded, which results in achieving superior dynamic voltage and frequency regulation.},

This technique aims to provide external support to an overloaded MG or the one with excessive renewable generation by coupling it to one or more suitable neighboring islanded MGs at the lowest cost. The selected neighboring MGs should have enough unused generation capacity or available loading capacity to support the overloaded or over-generating ones. The technique finds an optimal mixture of demand response (load decrease or increase), energy storage charging and discharging, and renewable curtailment as the other auxiliary options. It is based on a modified version of particle swarm optimization with a suitable convergence for near real-time applications.

Our results highlight several issues that arise for TCP over XG-PON, and emphasise the need for improved awareness of medium access control and scheduling in the context of specific TCP congestion control behaviour.},

These simplified models are used to simulate electrical (excluding switching) as well as control dynamics for each DG to setup and facilitate system level simulations. The paper focuses on the operation of components in grid forming mode using a droop based primary control. This approach is applied on a real microgrid which is set up within the IREN2 research project framework. The demonstrator incorporates a Li-Ion based Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), a plant oil driven generator as well as a BESS emulator. First, a brief overview of the detailed model for each DG including its simplification is discussed. Next, the microgrid is set up using simplified models for transient simulations and the comparison with real measurements is shown for different microgrid topologies. Later, overall microgrid stability i.e. various instability aspects in LV island grids are discussed. In this regard, an analytical method based on Eigenvalue analysis for identification of stability limits for relevant electrical and control parameters and under various loading conditions is presented. Finally, the complete microgrid model is simulated for potential instable conditions and a comparison with the analytical solution is shown.},

  abstract = {The growing interest in e-mobility and the increasing installation of renewable energy-based systems are leading to rapid improvements in lithium-ion batteries. In this context, battery manufacturers and engineers require advanced models in order to study battery performance accurately. A number of Li-ion battery models are based on the representation of physical phenomena by electrochemical equations. Although providing detailed physics-based information, these models cannot take into account all the phenomena for a whole battery, given the high complexity of the equations. Other models are based on equivalent circuits and are easier to design and use. However, they fail to relate these circuit parameters to physical properties. In order to take the best of both modeling techniques, we propose an equivalent circuit model which keeps a straight correlation between its parameters and the battery electrochemical principles. Consequently, this model has the required simplicity to be used in the simulation of a whole battery, while providing the depth of detail needed to identify physical phenomena. Moreover, due to its high accuracy, it can be used in a wide range of environments, as shown in the experimental validations carried out in the final section of this paper.},

Transmission and Distribution (T\&D) co-simulation is an effective tool to accurately consider the DERs and account for the changing power grid for various power system planning and operational studies. We have developed a T\&D co-simulation framework with commercial transmission system solvers like PSS/E that can handle largescale transmission networks, and accurate distribution system solver (GridLAB-D) that can model the distribution systems down to the house level and behind-themeter DERs. PSS/E and GridLAB-D are combined using HELICS environment and are driven using Python to enable multi-timescale T\&D co-simulation. This framework is scalable and parallel computing compatible that will enable large-scale system simulations. This framework will enable adoption of T\&D co-simulation methodology by the industry and utilities. The scalable multi-timescale T\&D co-simulation framework will be instrumental to enable faster integration of DERs by making the various planning and operational studies more accurate.},

The paper first presents a conceptual framework and design basis for the development of PCS models that display the key characteristics of communication systems architectures and technologies commonly-deployed for supporting electric distribution system operations. Next, the paper presents functional definitions, implementations, and an example use-case of how the PCS models can be used to support distribution system analysis. The approach used in this paper leverages existing open-source modeling and simulation tools. The network-simulator (ns-3) is used for the PCS, GridLAB-D™ is used for distribution system dynamic simulation, and Python™ is used to simulate the function of the distribution system control center. The Hierarchical Engine for Large-Scale Infrastructure Co-simulation (HELICS) environment is used as the primary co-simulation tool to federate the individual ns-3, GridLAB-D, and Python models into a single simulation. However, the PCS models can be used in other simulation environments. This paper presents the industry with a basis for developing PCS models and examples of how they can be used to conduct simulation and analysis to evaluate the impact of communication systems events on electrical distribution systems operations.},

  abstract = {The development of smart grid technologies has resulted in increased interdependence between power and communication systems. Many of the operations in the existing power system rely on a stable and secured communication system. For electrically weak systems and time-critical applications, this reliance can be even greater, where a small degradation in communication performance can degrade system stability. However, despite inter-dependencies between power and communication systems, only a few studies have investigated the impacts of communication system performance on power system dynamics. This study investigates the dependencies of power system dynamics operations on a communication system performance. First, a detailed, dynamic networked microgrid model is developed in the GridLAB-D simulation environment, along with a representative multi-traffic, multi-channel, multi-protocol communication system model, developed in the network simulator (ns-3). Second, a hierarchical engine for large-scale infrastructure co-simulation framework is developed to cosimulate microgrid dynamics, its communication system, and a microgrid control system. The impact of communication system delays on the dynamic stability of networked microgrids is evaluated for the loss of generation using three use-cases. While the example use-cases examine microgrid applications and the impact to resiliency, the framework can be applied to all levels of power system operations.},

Convergence to the configuration of minimum losses and feasible voltages is proved analytically for both a synchronous and an asynchronous version of the algorithm, where agents update their state independently one from the other.

  abstract = {The impact of the increasing connection of distributed generation to medium voltage feeders, with particular reference to photovoltaic (PV) units, justifies the investigation on secondary voltage/VAR control (VVC) schemes able to improve the utilization of available control resources and to reduce reactive power flows. This paper deals with a secondary VVC scheme based on a distributed multi-agent approach that requires only the estimation of the reactive power flows between the buses, where the PV units with reactive power control capability are connected. Phasor measurement units are used to get the relevant information. In general, distributed control approaches are expected to work adequately even by using communication infrastructures with lower performances than those required by centralized approaches. This paper addresses such an issue by the analysis of the distributed VVC performance when a shared cellular network is used for the cooperative adjustment of PV inverters reactive power outputs and of tap positions of transformers equipped with on-load tap changers. The analysis is carried out by using a specifically developed information and communications technology-power co-simulation platform. It is shown that the VVC scheme has adequate performances also in the presence of significant levels of background traffic and data loss.},

While the rise of voltage magnitudes can be limited e.g. by distribution transformers (DTs) with on-load tap changers, high line loadings cannot even be detected by network operators due to a lack of network observability. LV state estimation (SE) systems can provide a way to determine the required network states and line loadings. Measured operational network variables, e.g. voltage magnitudes and power values of PV systems, can be used as input data for the SE. Nevertheless, power measurements of households are not available and thus the household loads have to be approximately determined. This paper presents approximate active power distributions (AAPDs) for standard household loads, derived on the basis of field-trial data. They are an innovative way for the necessary generation of active power pseudo-values (APPVs) for LV SE with statistical errors following a Gaussian distribution. Despite the simplicity of the AAPDs the errors made within the current calculation is acceptable.},

Owing to a lack of network observability in present LV grids, distribution system operators (DSOs) cannot detect and respond to any limit violations. Even with data collected by the expected rollout of smart meters, full network observability will not be achieved. Thus, the network state will not be completely known. LV-state estimation (SE) in combination with pseudo-value generation can provide a way to determine the required network states with respect to voltage magnitudes and line loadings.

The performance of the presented SE approach was investigated on a realistic grid model for different cases with and without pseudo-values. The performance is promising and the approach can be used to provide DSOs with input data for control actions to avoid limit violations and thus will contribute to the further integration of DG.},

  abstract = {A smart grid power system for a small region consisting of 1,000 residential homes with electric heating appliances from the demand side, and a generic generation mix of nuclear, hydro, coal, gas and oil-based generators representing the supply side, is investigated using agent-based simulations. The simulation includes a transactive load control in a real-time pricing electricity market. The study investigates the impacts of adding wind power and demand response (DR) on both greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and generator cycling requirements. The results demonstrate and quantify the effectiveness of DR in mitigating the variability of renewable generation. The extent to which greenhouse gas emissions can be mitigated is found to be highly dependent on the mix of generators and their operational capacity factors. It is expected that the effects of demand response on electricity use can reduce dependency on fossil fuel-based electricity generation. However, the anticipated mitigation of GHG emissions is found to dependent on the number and efficiency of fossil fuel generators, and especially on the capacity factor at which they operate. Therefore, if a generator (the marginal seller) is forced to use less efficient fossil fuel power generation schemes, it will result in higher GHG emissions. The simulations show that DR can yield a small reduction in GHG emissions, but also lead to a smaller increase in emissions in circumstances when, for example, a generator (the marginal seller) is forced to use less efficient fossil fuel power generation schemes. Nonetheless, DR is shown to enhance overall system operation, particularly by facilitating increased penetration of variable renewable electricity generation without jeopardizing grid operation reliability. DR reduces the amount of generator cycling by an increased order of magnitude, thereby reducing wear and tear, improving generator efficiency, and avoiding the need for additional operating reserves. The effectiveness of DR for these uses depends on the participation of responsive loads, and this study highlights the need to maintain a certain degree of diversity of loads to ensure they can provide adequate responsiveness to the changing grid conditions.},

This limited information may lead to an increase in the operational cost of the multimicrogrid (MMG) systems. This paper suggests informing the CEMS about the adjustable power also, in addition to the surplus and shortage information. This additional information will result in a variety of options for the CEMS to fulfill the load demands of its network. CEMS will choose among various available options, which include trading with the power grid, buying from a controllable distributed generation plant, buying from a community battery energy storage system (CBESS), or controlling the adjustable power: increasing or decreasing the generation of controllable units. CBESS can either be controlled by CEMS or can act as an autonomous entity. The effects of both the operational options have been analyzed and economically efficient mode is suggested for MMG systems. Demand response (DR) is also considered in the proposed model. The incorporation of DR will ensure the supply reliability of the MMG system in addition to the reduction in operational cost. In contrast to the conventional single or two-step multimicrogrid optimization algorithms, a multistep hierarchical optimization algorithm based on a multiagent system is proposed in this paper. Easy to implement and computationally inexpensive mixed integer linear programming models are developed for each step.},

During the last decade, the microgrid concept has been studied and developed and nowadays it is becoming a reality. Hence, in the coming years a transformation of the current electric power system to a multi-microgrid power system can be expected. In this direction, the study of multi-microgrids is currently being explored. Accordingly, this paper examines the possible multi-microgrid architectures to form a grid of microgrids. For this purpose, the microgrid as a single entity and its possible interactions with external grids is first defined. Then, the possible multi-microgrid architectures are defined in terms of layout, line technology and interface technology. Finally, a comparison between the different architectures is performed in terms of cost, scalability, protection, reliability, stability, communications and business models. This analysis is expected to be of great utility for grid planners and policy makers, who can select the most adequate architecture in function of their necessities.},

In order to investigate the degree to which a cyber-contingency affects power system operations, we first categorize the potential impacts on the information flow respecting the end-to-end information features in terms of delayed, disordered, dropped, and distorted data. A simplified co-simulation model is then put forth for analyzing the interdependencies between energy and information flows, and obtaining the quantitative relation between information features and power system operations. As the operational characteristics of a cyber system can be entirely captured by all end-to-end information flows, our developed model is hence termed as the information flow based co-simulation model. The information flow based model features in low complexity and covering potential cyber contingencies. Moreover, the quantitative relation can provide requirements for the planning and operation of cyber systems. To illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model, a comparison with the commercial communication simulation software OPNET is made. Finally, a wide-area damping control application is taken as an example to demonstrate physical impacts of various cyber-contingencies.},

We overview a wide spectrum of applications starting from planning models with a time-scale of simulation in years to real-time models where the timescale can be in the order of milliseconds. We present a list of simulation software popularly used by the power engineering research community across the world.

The importance of research testbeds for testing, verification and validation of complex grid models at various temporal and spatial scales is also highlighted.

Optimal control functions are obtained in both time and frequency domains, and a discrete-time solution suitable for periodic feedback control systems is presented. The method is applied to North America Western Interconnection for the planning year 2024. It is shown that an optimal dispatch strategy that simultaneously considers both the cost of energy and the cost of ramping leads to significant cost savings in systems with high levels of renewable generation: the savings exceed 25\% of the total system operating cost for a 50\% renewables scenario.},

Hence, there is a need for comprehensive planning of charging infrastructure in order to prevent power failures or scenarios where there is a considerable demand-supply mismatch. Accurately predicting the realistic charging demand of EVs is an essential part of the infrastructure planning. Charging demand of EVs is influenced by several factors, such as driver behavior, location of charging stations, electricity pricing, etc. In order to implement an optimal charging infrastructure, it is important to consider all the relevant factors that influence the charging demand of EVs. Several studies have modeled and simulated the charging demands of individual and groups of EVs. However, in many cases, the models do not consider factors related to the social characteristics of EV drivers. Other studies do not emphasize on economic elements. This paper aims at evaluating the effects of the above factors on EV charging demand using a simulation model. An agent-based approach using NetLogo is employed in this paper to closely mimic the human aggregate behavior and its influence on the load demand due to charging of EVs.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a community microgrid with multiple ac and dc microgrids is introduced and analyzed. Individual microgrids with different frequency and voltage requirements would operate as self-controlled entities, which could also cooperate with neighboring microgrids for providing back-up operations in the community microgrid. A hierarchical coordination strategy with primary, secondary, and tertiary coordination is proposed for the economic operation of an islanded community microgrid. The hierarchical strategy is also applied to a grid-connected community microgrid and the results are discussed. The simulation results verify that the proposed hierarchical coordination strategy is an effective and efficient way for coordinating microgrid flows in an islanded community microgrid, while maintaining the rated frequency and voltage with each microgrid. The simulation results also demonstrate the economic operation of a grid-connected community microgrid in which individual microgrids operate as autonomous agents, while satisfying the community objectives.},

  abstract = {Smart Microgrid (SMG), integrated with renewable energy, energy storage system and advanced bidirectional communication network, has been envisioned to improve efficiency and reliability of power delivery. However, the stochastic nature of renewable energy and privacy concerns due to intensive bidirectional data exchange make the traditional energy management system (EMS) perform poorly. In order to improve operational efficiency and customers’ satisfaction, we propose a distributed cooperative energy management system (DCEMS). We adopt recurrent neural network with long short-term memory to predict the solar energy generation with high accuracy. We then solve the underlying economic dispatch problem with distributed scalable Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to avoid single point of failure problem and preserve customers’ privacy. In the first stage, each SMG optimizes its operation decision vector in a centralized manner based on one-day ahead solar energy generation prediction. In the second stage, all SMGs share their energy exchange information with directly connected neighboring SMGs to cooperatively optimize the global operation cost. The proposed DCEMS is deployed in our distributed SMGs emulation platform and its performance is compared with other approaches. The results show that the proposed DCEMS outperforms heuristic rule-based EMS by more than 30\%. It can also protect customers’ privacy and avoid single point of failure without degrading performance too much compared to centralized EMS.},

  abstract = {The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges for the utilities and grid operators around the world. In this work, we focus on the problem of load forecasting. With strict social distancing restrictions, power consumption profiles around the world have shifted both in magnitude and daily patterns. These changes have caused significant difficulties in short-term load forecasting. Typically algorithms use weather, timing information and previous consumption levels as input variables, yet they cannot capture large and sudden changes in socioeconomic behavior during the pandemic. In this paper, we introduce mobility as a measure of economic activities to complement existing building blocks of forecasting algorithms. Mobility data acts as good proxies for the population-level behaviors during the implementation and subsequent easing of social distancing measures. The major challenge with such dataset is that only limited mobility records are associated with the recent pandemic. To overcome this small data problem, we design a transfer learning scheme that enables knowledge transfer between several different geographical regions. This architecture leverages the diversity across these regions and the resulting aggregated model can boost the algorithm performance in each region's day-ahead forecast. Through simulations for regions in the US and Europe, we show our proposed algorithm can outperform conventional forecasting methods by more than three-folds. In addition, we demonstrate how the proposed model can be used to project how electricity consumption would recover based on different mobility scenarios.},

  abstract = {Recent critical embedded systems become more and more complex and usually react to their environment that requires to amend their behaviors by applying run-time reconfiguration scenarios. A system is defined in this paper as a set of networked devices, where each of which has its own operating system, a processor to execute related periodic software tasks, and a local battery. A reconfiguration is any operation allowing the addition-removal-update of tasks to adapt the device and the whole system to its environment. It may be a reaction to a fault or even optimization of the system functional behavior. Nevertheless, such scenario can cause the violation of real-time or energy constraints, which is considered as a critical run-time problem. We propose a multi-agent adaptive architecture to handle dynamic reconfigurations and ensure the correct execution of the concurrent real-time distributed tasks under energy constraints. The proposed architecture integrates a centralized scheduler agent (ScA) which is the common decision making element for the scheduling problem. It is able to carry out the required run-time solutions based on operation research techniques and mathematical tools for the system's feasibility. This architecture assigns also a reconfiguration agent (RAp) to each device p to control and handle the local reconfiguration scenarios under the instructions of ScA. A token-based protocol is defined in this case for the coordination between the different distributed agents in order to guarantee the whole system's feasibility under energy constraints.},

In general, traditional N − 1 contingency analysis methods simulate a few outages, due to the high computational costs involved. Thus, they may fail to identify some critical contingencies that can lead to cascading failures. This paper proposes a new approach to N − 1 contingency analysis of electric transmission systems, based on network centrality measures. The proposed method evaluates all possible transmission line outages in a very short computational time, and it requires only topological information. Results are shown for two electric power systems: ITAIPU 11 bus and IEEE 39 bus. Comparisons between the results obtained by the proposed method and traditional ones show the accuracy of the proposed method to identify critical buses and transmission lines, in local and global context, even in absence of electrical information. The proposed method is interesting as a direct and fast tool applied to the pre-analysis process, since topological network behavior is verified. Thus, pre-analysis provides a prior response to the system operator of the points by which the electrical power system analysis should begin, in order to ensure safe operational state of the system.},

The microgrid is unbalanced, due to unequal loads in each phase and non-equilateral conductor spacings on the distribution lines. Similar to OPF formulations for balanced systems, the considered OPF problem is nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique is advocated to obtain a convex problem solvable in polynomial-time complexity. Enticingly, numerical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to attain the globally optimal solution of the original nonconvex OPF. To ensure scalability with respect to the number of nodes, robustness to isolated communication outages, and data privacy and integrity, the proposed SDP is solved in a distributed fashion by resorting to the alternating direction method of multipliers. The resulting algorithm entails iterative message-passing among groups of consumers and guarantees faster convergence compared to competing alternatives.},

Aging costs based on the depth-of-discharge result in shallow cycles and a strong dependency on driving behavior, because the state-of-charge affects the discharging process.

The problem is expressed as a mixed integer programming (MIP) optimization model in which the expected profit is maximized while the uncertainty of forecasted market price is modeled as a fuzzy variable. The volatility of market price is identified by certain fuzzy definitions pertaining to market volatility. The proposed model can be solved using a standard mixed integer-programming (MIP) solver.

  abstract = {The electrification of current networks is developing to modernize and have a complete smart structure. Rural network electrification as a special part of the power grid will play a vital role in the future smart grid. However, energy management and balancing the supply and demand in rural area have created challenges for the distribution companies. In response to the mentioned challenges, the transactive energy (TE) as a new market based technology is applied to integrate the nine villages and manage the energy exchanging among them optimally. In order to evaluate the effects of TE technology on the rural network integration, three models are considered for analysis of the energy cost of each village and energy not supplied (ENS) in the presence of the renewable energy resources. First model assumed that none of the villages is equipped with renewable energy resources and all their electricity demand is fully provided by the power grid. While the renewable and non-renewable energy resources are considered for two other models. In the second model (individual mode), the villages cannot exchange energy with each other (local transaction market) and they can only connect to the power grid, but in the third model (integrated mode) the villages have an interconnected situation and may exchange energy with each other and grid under the TE management. Simulation results for the nine villages located in India are presented and evaluated. The results investigation indicated that the cost of energy and ENS are improved in the third model in comparison to other models.},

For the power systems perspective, results show that the scheme is able to achieve a 21\% reduction in peak demand compared to uncontrolled charging, and a better performance in flattening the overall demand profile and maintaining network constraints in comparison to a benchmark scenario. The scheme has also been demonstrated to successfully coordinate PEVs to take maximum utilization of local renewable energy. For the communications perspective, the measured upstream traffic for executing the proposed IntVGR scheme on a residential area of 342 households is found to be 1–2 Mbps with an end-to-end latency level of 1 ms. The scheme has also been validated from both perspectives in a sensitivity analysis with a higher PEV adoption rate.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an efficient computational framework with the purpose of generating weighted pseudo-measurements to improve the quality of distribution system state estimation (DSSE) and provide observability with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) against unobservable customers and missing data. The proposed technique is based on a game-theoretic expansion of relevance vector machines (RVMs). This platform is able to estimate the nodal power consumption and quantify its uncertainty while reducing the prohibitive computational burden of model training for large AMI datasets. To achieve this objective, the large training set is decomposed and distributed among multiple parallel learning entities. The resulting estimations from the parallel RVMs are then combined using a game-theoretic model based on the idea of repeated games with vector payoff. It is observed that through this approach and by exploiting the seasonal changes in customers’ behavior the accuracy of pseudo-measurements can be considerably improved, while introducing robustness against bad training data samples. The proposed pseudo-measurement generation model is integrated into a DSSE using a closed-loop information system, which takes advantage of a branch current state estimator (BCSE) to further improve the performance of the designed machine learning framework. This method has been tested on a practical distribution feeder model with smart meter data for verification.},

  abstract = {Wind energy can be considered a push-driver factor in the integration of renewable energy sources within the concept of smart grids. For its full deployment, it requires a modern telecommunication infrastructure for transmitting control signals around the distributed generation, in which, the wireless communication standards stand out for employing modern digital modulation and coding schemes for error correction, in order to guarantee the power plant operability. In some developing countries, such as Brazil, the high penetration of commercial mobile wireless standards GPRS and EGPRS (based on GSM technology) have captivated the interests of the energy sector, and they now seek to perform remote monitoring and control operations. In this context, this article presents a comparative performance analysis of a wireless control system for a wind SRG, when a GPRS or EGPRS data service is employed. The system performance is analyzed by co-simulations, including the wind generator dynamics and the wireless channel effects. The satisfactory results endorse the viability and robustness of the proposed system.},

We propose it as a viable new approach to stochastic combinatorial optimization. The main characteristics of this model are positive feedback, distributed computation, and the use of a constructive greedy heuristic. Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence, and the greedy heuristic helps find acceptable solutions in the early stages of the search process. We apply the proposed methodology to the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP), and report simulation results. We also discuss parameter selection and the early setups of the model, and compare it with tabu search and simulated annealing using TSP. To demonstrate the robustness of the approach, we show how the ant system (AS) can be applied to other optimization problems like the asymmetric traveling salesman, the quadratic assignment and the job-shop scheduling. Finally we discuss the salient characteristics-global data structure revision, distributed communication and probabilistic transitions of the AS.},

Microgrids schedule local resources based on a cooperative distributed model predictive control algorithm scheme with neighbor-to-neighbor communication. Tests are performed in an active distribution network with three microgrids. The numerical studies have shown that the proposed strategy mitigates the voltage fluctuation rapidly and efficiently with minimum operating cost.},

The electromagnetic transient (EMT) power system emulation is conducted on the Xilinx FPGA boards to provide nearly continuous instantaneous waveforms for cyber layer sampling; the communication layer is simulated on the ARM CPU cores of the embedded NVIDIA Jetson platform for flexible computing, and programming;, and the control functions for modular multi-level converters are executed on GPU cores of the Jetson platform for parallel calculation. The data exchange between FPGAs, and Jetson is achieved via the PCI express interface, which simulates the sampling operation of the AC phasor measurement unit (PMU), and DC merging unit (DC-MU). The power overflow, and DC fault cases are investigated to demonstrate the validity, and effectiveness of the proposed co-emulation hardware architecture, and global control schemes.},

  abstract = {Power systems with high penetration rates of inverter-based generation units exhibit reduced system inertia. Faults like plant outages or fault-induced system splits then cause an increased rate of change of frequency and may lead to frequency instability. One of the proposed schemes to provide synthetic inertia with power electronic converters is the frequency-derivative-based (d f /d t) approach. Converters with this method inject an active current that is proportional to the derivative of the grid frequency to mimic the inertia of synchronous plants. Specification of synthetic inertia is currently being discussed for future grid codes. In this paper, we show that the frequency derivative in the d f /d t controller is subject to a severe bandwidth limitation. Considerable low-pass filtering is indispensable to avoid instability due to the excitation of local oscillation modes in the harmonic frequency range. We have found a first-order lag with a time constant around 1 s to be required for a robustly stable system with common parameters. A new discrete-time linear model that accurately represents sampling effects is introduced and comprehensively described. A d f /d t control design is proposed that leads to a robustly stable system. Model and control design are validated by laboratory experiments, especially regarding mechanisms of instability. The main finding of this paper—applying a d f /d t controller harbors the risk of merely shifting the initial danger of system-wide frequency instability to local stability problems—is important for power plant manufacturers as well as system operators.},

Based on the linearised model, a general conclusion is established to assess the capability of the ESS-based stabiliser to affect the damping of the inter-area power oscillation. Analysis derived from the general conclusion explains how and why the robustness of the ESS stabiliser is different to the variations of the loading conditions of the tie transmission line when the stabiliser is realised by controlling the exchange of either active or reactive power between the ESS and the rest of the power system. It is analytically concluded that when the stabiliser is implemented via controlling the exchange of active power, the stabiliser is of better robustness. The study presents an example multi-machine power system installed with a battery energy storage system (BESS)-based stabiliser. Results of eigensolutions computation and non-linear simulation demonstrate and confirm the analytical conclusion about the robustness of the ESS-based stabiliser in suppressing the interarea power oscillation.},

  abstract = {A multiagent-based distribution automation solution is proposed to be used in the distribution of selfhealing grids to solve the service restoration part of the Fault Location, Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR) task. The solution reduces the grid topology to an undirected weighted graph and executes a distributed implementation of Prim’s minimum spanning tree algorithm to solve the problem. The solution is compliant with state-ofthe-art standards within smart grids, including but not limited to IEC61850. To test the performance of the algorithm, a testbed is assembled consisting of a physical dc grid model and several Arduino microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi computers. The test results show that the proposed algorithm can handle complex FLISR scenarios.},

First, the microgrid acts in the day-ahead market to find the optimal schedule for its internal resources, considering the consumption and generation forecast and the energy price prediction. Once the day-ahead market has closed, external agents such as other microgrids in the same network, aggregators or electric vehicles can interact with the microgrid through a local energy market. If an external agent requests a specific energy profile that offers an economic benefit, the microgrid controller will propose supplying the closest profile to that requested, depending on the benefit offered. The proposed solution allows the microgrid to respond to external requests, thus optimizing its economic benefit. The problem is solved using model predictive control (MPC), and the operation and degradation costs are included in the objective function. In order to capture both continuous/discrete dynamics and switching between different operating conditions, the plant is modeled using the mixed logic dynamic framework. The MPC problem is solved by means of mixed-integer quadratic programming.},

Nevertheless, recent research has shown that specific characteristics of NCI can be exploited in the enabling of more efficient mitigation techniques, while novel techniques from the field of IP networks can bring significant advantages. In this paper we explore the interconnection of NCI communication infrastructures with Software Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled network topologies. SDN provides the means to create virtual networking services and to implement global networking decisions. It relies on OpenFlow to enable communication with remote devices and has been recently categorized as the “Next Big Technology”, which will revolutionize the way decisions are implemented in switches and routers. Therefore, the paper documents the first steps towards enabling an SDN-NCI and presents the impact of a Denial of Service experiment over traffic resulting from an XBee sensor network which is routed across an emulated SDN network.},

A key concern, however, is the vulnerability of the SDN controller as a single point of failure. In this paper, we develop a cyberphysical simulation platform that interconnects Mininet (an SDN emulator), hardware SDN switches, and PowerWorld (a high-fidelity, industry-strength power grid simulator). We report initial experiments on how a number of representative controller faults may impact the delay of smart grid communications. We further evaluate how this delay may affect the performance of the underlying physical system, namely automatic gain control (AGC) as a fundamental closed-loop control that regulates the grid frequency to a critical nominal value. Our results show that when the fault-induced delay reaches seconds (e.g., more than four seconds in some of our experiments), degradation of the AGC becomes evident. Particularly, the AGC is most vulnerable when it is in a transient following say step changes in loading, because the significant state fluctuations will exacerbate the effects of using a stale system state in the control.},

Some of these features are demonstrated using two experiments on a real building HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) system, which is a part of the test bed. Both experiments focus on control for buildings-grid integration applications. In the first experiment, several distributed control agents coordinate with one another to limit the fan power consumption of an air-handling unit (AHU).

Leveraging this new capability will provide greater resiliency to the power system as a whole. The goal of this paper is to discuss three different algorithms which use networked MGs to support the BPS voltage when a contingency at the bulk grid results in abnormally low voltages, which may be a precursor to voltage collapse. These algorithms are (1) distributed optimal power flow, (2) distributed consensus, and (3) fully decentralized collaborative autonomy. Our comparitive analysis includes both qualitative and quantitative assessment of the three algorithms and a discussion on the trade-offs between the decentralized and distributed methods. Each algorithm was evaluated on the IEEE 13-bus system modified to include 5 connected MGs and a The´venin equivalent of the BPS. It was found that each of the algorithms excels in different ways and may be used under different scenarios depending on the state, operations, and priorities of the power and communication systems.},

These algorithms require reliable communication networks to operate. The nature of the communication network plays an indispensable role for feasible operation of the power system and collaboration among microgrids.

Financial analysis is performed through a business model approach to test for viability when replacing a researched energy expenditure baseline in Bangladesh. A literature review compares the approach to current trends in microgrids. A case study of Bangladesh illustrates the potential for building on the existing infrastructure base of solar home systems. Opportunities are identified to improve access to reliable energy through a microgrid approach that aims at community-driven economic and infrastructure development by building on network effects generated through the inclusion of localized economies with strong producer-consumer linkages embedded within larger systems of trade and exchange. The analysed approach involves the linking together of individual stand-alone energy systems to form a microgrid that can eventually interconnect with present legacy infrastructure consisting of national or regional grids. The approach is likened to the concept of swarm intelligence, where each individual node brings independent input to create a conglomerate of value greater than the sum of its parts.},

It becomes evident that contemporary approaches are either not suitable for actors in the overall system or fail to provide the needed services in the long term to a large part, undermining its sustainability. Common solar home system approaches will not exceed providing a tier 2 level of electricity service. Minigrids, on the other hand, supposed to fill this gap, are neither working to meet their potential nor the demand of the users thus far. It results that in order to meet the needs and the capabilities of all agents involved, complex behavior of the system ought to be embraced rather than shielded against. Engineering and design must go away from loads estimation and supply side layout and move towards incorporating the possibility of flexibility, upgrading, extension and stabilization into the system, no matter its size or concrete appearance. The authors further look into the concept of swarm electrification, investigating its systemic properties against common electrification approaches for the exemplary case of Bangladesh. It is shown that avoiding the impacts of legacy infrastructures, but integrating existing resources with leapfrogging technology through the use of the convergence and innovations in ICT and energy access, may lead to more resilient and ultimately sustainable energy infra-systems.},

In particular, the thermal dynamics of each zone are coupled with those of its neighboring zones. In this paper, we study an agent-based approach to model and control commercial building HVAC system for providing ancillary services to the power grid. In the multi-agent-building-system (MABS), individual zones are modeled as agents that can communicate, interact, and negotiate with one another to achieve a common objective. We first propose a distributed characterization method on the aggregate airflow (and thus fan power) flexibility that the HVAC system can provide to the ancillary service market. A Nash-bargaining-based airflow allocation strategy is then proposed to track a dispatch signal while respecting the preference and flexibility of individual zones. Moreover, we devise a distributed algorithm to obtain the Nash bargaining solution via dual decomposition. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed distributed protocols are much more scalable than centralized approaches especially when the system becomes larger and more complex.},

  abstract = {Electricity generation is one of the major contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. Transitioning the World’s energy economy to a lower carbon future will require significant investment in a variety of cleaner technologies, including renewables and nuclear power. In the short term, improving the efficiency of fossil fuel combustion in energy generation can provide an important contribution. Availability of life cycle GHG intensity data will allow decision-makers to move away from overly simplistic assertions about the relative merits of certain fuels, and focus on the complete picture, especially the critical roles of technology selection and application of best practice. This analysis compares the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) intensities per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced for a range of Australian and other energy sources, including coal, conventional liquefied natural gas (LNG), coal seam gas LNG, nuclear and renewables, for the Australian export market. When Australian fossil fuels are exported to China, life cycle greenhouse gas emission intensity in electricity production depends to a significant degree on the technology used in combustion. LNG in general is less GHG intensive than black coal, but the gap is smaller for gas combusted in open cycle gas turbine plant (OCGT) and for LNG derived from coal seam gas (CSG). On average, conventional LNG burned in a conventional OCGT plant is approximately 38\% less GHG intensive over its life cycle than black coal burned in a sub-critical plant, per MWh of electricity produced. However, if OCGT LNG combustion is compared to the most efficient new ultra-supercritical coal power, the GHG intensity gap narrows considerably. Coal seam gas LNG is approximately 13–20\% more GHG intensive across its life cycle, on a like-for like basis, than conventional LNG. Upstream fugitive emissions from CSG (assuming best practice gas extraction techniques) do not materially alter the life cycle GHG intensity rankings, such is the dominance of end-use combustion, but application of the most recent estimates of the 20-year global warming potential (GWP) increases the contribution of fugitives considerably if best practice fugitives management is not assumed. However, if methane leakage approaches the elevated levels recently reported in some US gas fields (circa 4\% of gas production) and assuming a 20-year methane GWP, the GHG intensity of CSG-LNG generation is on a par with sub-critical coal-fired generation. The importance of applying best practice to fugitives management in Australia’s emerging natural gas industry is evident. When exported to China for electricity production, LNG was found to be 22–36 times more GHG intensive than wind and concentrated solar thermal (CST) power and 13–21 times more GHG intensive than nuclear power which, even in the post-Fukushima world, continues to be a key option for global GHG reduction.},

  abstract = {The protection challenges introduced by penetration of renewable-based generation in the distribution network stipulates the use of pilot directional protection schemes. The transient-based pilot directional protection techniques are widely used in high voltage and ultra-high voltage transmission networks because they offer reliable and fast operation with reasonable communication demands. However, their application in modern distribution network has not been explored so far. Ever since the advent of RALDA relay in 1978 by ASEA, relay manufacturers have investigated and developed different methods to determine fault direction based on delta quantities. These algorithms are fundamentally different in terms of their operating principle. This paper introduces the development and design principles of some of the existing methods along with some alternate pilot directional protection schemes including current-only solutions. Moreover, the performance evaluation for a 22kV modern distribution system has also been conducted. Finally, the performance of all the tested algorithms are compared and the limitations of each of the techniques are summarized.},

In the proposed algorithm, Teager energy operator is used to extract traveling waves. Teager energy operator has a high computational efficiency and extracts traveling waves with high resolution. The amplitude of the first detected traveling wave as well as that of the traveling waves which are detected in 2L/v and 2(L−x)/v seconds (“L” is the line length, x is an initial guess about the fault location, and “v” is the traveling wave propagation speed) after the first one are used to discriminate internal and external faults. Then the traveling wave propagation speed and the time difference between the first and the second traveling waves are used to find the fault location. This process can also be used for the internal fault identification. Finally, two decision trees and the amplitude of initial current traveling waves in different modes are used for the fault type classification and faulted phase selection. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is investigated by test signals which are simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC, and the algorithm is implemented in MATLAB.},

  abstract = {Large-scale battery storage will become an essential part of the future smart grid. This paper investigates the optimal bidding strategy for battery storage in power markets. Battery storage could increase its profitability by providing fast regulation service under a performance-based regulation mechanism, which better exploits a battery’s fast ramping capability. However, battery life might be decreased by frequent charge–discharge cycling, especially when providing fast regulation service. It is profitable for battery storage to extend its service life by limiting its operational strategy to some degree. Thus, we incorporate a battery cycle life model into a profit maximization model to determine the optimal bids in day-ahead energy, spinning reserve, and regulation markets. Then a decomposed online calculation method to compute cycle life under different operational strategies is proposed to reduce the complexity of the model. This novel bidding model would help investor-owned battery storages better decide their bidding and operational schedules and investors to estimate the battery storage’s economic viability. The validity of the proposed model is proven by case study results.},

To reconcile external reserve provision and internal risk hedging for MMGs, a novel comprehensive multi-area dynamic optimal power flow (MADOPF) model is established, where energy-reserve co-optimization, three-phase unbalanced network intrinsics and dual control time-scales are all addressed. To better hedge the uncertainties of distributed generation and loads, distributionally robust model predictive control (MPC) is applied to the MADOPF problem. To preserve operational independence and information privacy for each microgrid, decomposition of the nonconvex model is devised with guaranteed convergence. Numerical tests on a two-area system and a real large-scale 16-area system derived from Shandong Power Grid validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The advantages are demonstrated by the comparison with the conventional MPC, stochastic and robust methods.},

In order to elaborate the role of microgrids in enhancing the resilience of power systems, a three-step analysis is carried out in this paper. In the first step, the general backgrounds of resilience in power systems are presented, which comprise of disaster modeling, resilience analysis methods, and resilience enhancement efforts by different regions. In the second step, the use of microgrids as a resilience resource is analyzed, where formation of microgrids, networked microgrids, and dynamic microgrids along with resiliency of multi-energy networks are explored. In the third step, the strategies utilized by microgrids for enhancing their resilience during major outage events are analyzed. These strategies include proactive scheduling, outage management, feasible islanding, and advanced operation strategies for reducing the impact of major disruptions. The classification of these operation strategies is based on the event occurrence and clearance times. In addition, the resilience strategies used by different types of microgrids, types of energy management systems, communication resilience, and resilience of individual components in microgrids are also analyzed. Finally, research gaps in the existing literature and future directions for improving the available resilience-oriented operation methods for enhancing the resilience of microgrids are presented.},

  abstract = {The dependence of modern societies on electric energy is ever increasing by the emergence of smart cities and electric vehicles. This is while unprecedented number of cyber-physical hazards are threatening the integrity and availability of the power grid on a daily basis. On one hand, physical integrity of power systems is under threat by more frequent natural disasters and intentional attacks. On the other hand, the cyber vulnerability of power grids is on the rise by the emergence of smart grid technologies. This underlines an imminent need for the modeling and examination of power grid vulnerabilities to cyber-physical attacks. This paper examines the vulnerability of the communication-assisted protection schemes like permissive overreaching transfer trip to cyberattacks using a co-simulation platform. The simulation results show that the transient angle stability of power systems can be jeopardized by cyberattacks on the communication-assisted protection schemes. To address this vulnerability, two physical solutions including the deployment of communication channel redundancy, and a more advanced communicated-assisted protection scheme, i.e., directional comparison unblocking scheme (DCUB), are considered and tested. The proposed solutions address the vulnerability of the communication-assisted protection schemes to distributed denial of service attack to some extent. Yet, the simulation results show the vulnerability of the proposed solutions to sophisticated cyberattacks like false data injection attacks. This highlights the need for the development of cyber-based solutions for communication channel monitoring.},

The objective of this paper is to present a VVO approach that controls system’s legacy voltage control devices and coordinates their operation with smart inverter control. An optimal power flow (OPF) formulation is proposed by developing linear and nonlinear power flow approximations for a three-phase unbalanced electric power distribution system. A bi-level VVO approach is proposed, where Level 1 optimizes the control of legacy devices and smart inverters using a linear approximate three-phase power flow. In Level 2, the control parameters for smart inverters are adjusted to obtain an optimal and feasible solution by solving the approximate nonlinear OPF model. Level 1 is modeled as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) while Level 2 as a nonlinear program with linear objective and quadratic constraints. The proposed approach is validated using 13-bus and 123-bus three-phase IEEE test feeders and a 329bus three-phase PNNL taxonomy feeder. The results demonstrate the applicability of the framework in achieving the CVR objective. It is demonstrated that the proposed coordinated control approach help us to reduce the feeder’s power demand by reducing the bus voltages; the proposed approach maintains an average feeder voltage of 0.96 p.u. A higher energy saving is reported during the minimum load conditions. The results and approximation steps are thoroughly validated using OpenDSS.},

The existing scalable D-OPF algorithms either use approximations that are not valid for an unbalanced power distribution system, or apply relaxation techniques to the nonlinear power flow equations that do not guarantee a feasible power flow solution. In this paper, we propose scalable D-OPF algorithms that simultaneously achieve optimal and feasible solutions by solving multiple iterations of approximate, or relaxed, D-OPF subproblems of low complexity. The first algorithm is based on a successive linear approximation of the nonlinear power flow equations around the current operating point, where the D-OPF solution is obtained by solving multiple iterations of a linear programming (LP) problem. The second algorithm is based on the relaxation of the nonlinear power flow equations as conic constraints together with directional constraints, which achieves optimal and feasible solutions over multiple iterations of a secondorder cone programming (SOCP) problem. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms are able to reach an optimal and feasible solution while significantly reducing the computation time as compared to an equivalent NLP D-OPF model for the same distribution system.},

A large meshed DC grid can have more DC lines, and since we can not control power in all lines/cables, an overload may result. In this paper, two methods are proposed for DC power flow control through DC lines/cables. The first method involves using extra resistors embedded in series with DC lines/cables and switched by mechanical or semiconductor based DC circuit breakers. The other method includes installing DC/DC converter at one of the DC line/cable ends with the purpose of DC power flow control. It is shown that the first approach suits better for a short transmission line/cable, while the second one is proposed for a long transmission line/cable with high rated current and higher voltage drop.

Unlike existing models, the proposal departs from the equivalent generator representation of the PV plant and is based instead on the operation and control modes of PV panels and voltage source converters. The resulting set of nonlinear equations is assembled together with the network's equations to formulate a generalized power flow problem in a unified frame of reference, which is efficiently solved by using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. The complementarity condition approach is adopted for directly including all operation and control mode constraints of the PV plant in the power flow formulation, which permits the simultaneous and automatic handling of limits of all state variables associated with these constraints during the iterative solution process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is fully demonstrated by numerical examples.},

However, intermittent issues of RES and high cost of ESS need to be placed under scrutiny for economic operation of microgrids. This paper presents a two-layer predictive energy management system (EMS) for microgrids with hybrid ESS consisting of batteries and supercapacitors. Incorporating degradation costs of the hybrid ESS with respect to the depth of charge and lifetime, long-term costs of batteries and supercapacitors are modeled and transformed to short-term costs related to real-time operation. In order to maintain high system robustness at minimum operational cost, a hierarchical dispatch model is proposed to determine the scheduling of utilities in microgrids within a finite time horizon, in which the upper layer EMS minimizes the total operational cost and the lower layer EMS eliminates fluctuations induced by forecast errors. Simulation studies demonstrate that different types of energy storages can be utilized at two control layers for multiple decision-making objectives. Scenarios incorporating different pricing schemes, prediction horizon lengths, and forecast accuracies also verify the effectiveness of the proposed EMS structure.},

In this paper we present a method to simulate, design and test the adequacy of a communication system for a particular transmission grid. The main difference from typical communication system studies is that we formulate the communication requirements from the power grid application requirements, that is, the communication design, simulation and testing is from the viewpoint of the anticipated power applications.

The active/reactive power sharing, the frequency/voltage, and the energy of BESSs are synchronized by exchanging local information with a few other neighboring BESSs. Two consensus algorithms namely leaderless and leader-follower are proposed. The proposed control architecture offers unique features. First, the heterogeneous nature of BESSs is explicitly taken into account in BESS models and consensus designs, while it is usually ignored in the literature. Second, the proposed designs bring the plug-and-play capability to the smart grid system by operating in both islanded and gridconnected modes. Next, the nominal frequencies and nominal voltage magnitudes of BESSs are used in the consensus design instead of their frequencies and voltage magnitudes. This makes the proposed structure much easier to be implemented in the real power grids. Lastly, an additional control input is designed to synchronize the energy levels of BESSs directly, whereas the energy levels of BESSs are synchronized indirectly through their powers in other existing research. Time-domain simulations on a modified IEEE 57-bus power system are then carried out to validate the proposed control structure and the consensus designs.},

However, since communication infrastructure and the power grid are tightly coupled with each other in the smart grid, a well-defined combination of simulation tools for the systems is required for the simulation study. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a cosimulation work called OOCoSim, which consists of OPNET (network simulation tool) and OpenDSS (power system simulation tool). By employing the simulation tool, an organic and dynamic cosimulation can be realized since both simulators operate on the same computing platform and provide external interfaces through which the simulation can be managed dynamically. In this paper, we provide OOCoSim design principles including a synchronization scheme and detailed descriptions of its implementation. To present the effectiveness of OOCoSim, we define a smart grid application model and conduct a simulation study to see the impact of the defined application and the underlying network system on the distribution system. The simulation results show that the proposed OOCoSim can successfully simulate the integrated scenario of the power and network systems and produce the accurate effects of the networked control in the smart grid.},

The success factors are derived from case study analyses of microgrids implemented in the Global South and in communities of Germany. The goal of the research is to develop a mutual understanding of common values and so support future developments. The analysis covers the categories of ownership and participation; technology and system design; and policy and financing. The results show that microgrids in the Global South and renewable-energy-based communities in Germany share a number of success factors. The results demonstrate that a high share of ownership by users and the flexibility to expand the microgrid with user needs are particularly promising features. To verify the application of the identified success factors, the latter are applied to analyze the microgrid concept of “swarm electrification”. The analysis concludes that the concept of swarm electrification is consistent with the success factors, making it a high-potential approach for renewable-energy-based electrification.},

Using estimated solar data for the site's location, wind data measured locally, household and population data collected over the course of several months and typical measured domestic demand profiles, DC microgrid system models have been constructed using HOMER and Simulink software to represent the DC system proposed. This work is innovative in using a range of on-site data collected and measured locally in a commissioned field study carried out over several months to quantify current local resources and loads and estimating future ones based on the local population's current economic and domestic activities, and intended ones. This data is used in determining both the optimal size of the generation and storage elements through HOMER based on long term system behaviour, and to model shorter term system response to changes in generation and load using Simulink, ensuring system stability and grid voltage is maintained. Further novel aspects of this study are that power flow is controlled using adaptive DC droop control on each individual energy source to enable optimal power sharing with minimum power dissipation across distribution lines, and the droop control has been further adapted to the case of storage which can act as a source or a load.},

We investigate the effect of communication delays in an EV aggregator’s domain on the regulation performance. We present an underlying communication network for the EV aggregator controlling a group of EVs at a parking lot. The underlying communication network consists of two separate subnetworks: 1) a power line communication network between a pair of EV and EV supply equipment (EVSE) and 2) an LTE network between one EV aggregator and a group of EVSEs. In order to evaluate the delay effect on the regulation performance, we propose a co-simulation platform which is composed of an LTE network model and a load frequency control model. For the LTE network, we analyze the potential sources of delays and identify the repeated service request and release procedures as a critical delay source. We implement the identified repeated procedure by using network simulator-3 and evaluate the delay performance of frequency regulation service. We evaluate the effect of the communication delay in the EV aggregator’s domain on regulation performance.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a distributed optimal power flow (OPF) algorithm for the system-level control of multi-terminal DC (MTDC) distribution grids with distributed energy resources (DER). At each control period, the algorithm updates the nominal voltage and power set-points of the DER-interfacing converters, which operate according to active network management (ANM) concepts. To achieve this, the OPF problem, in its nodal formulation, includes power dispatch strategies for diverse DER according to their technical characteristics, which change during the system operation. This multi-objective OPF-for-ANM problem is solved by distributed control units (DCUs) according to the distributed algorithm for the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). All DCUs have identical roles in the distributed control structure and thus the distributed OPF-for-ANM algorithm is highly modular. Simulation results in different IEEE standard systems and various scenarios demonstrate that the algorithm is fast and scalable, irrespective of the number and location of integrated DER, as well as the operating condition of the system. The convergence speed of the algorithm is analysed considering the computation and communication time needed for its execution. The online application in a computers cluster demonstrates the fast execution of the developed algorithm in a physically-distributed implementation. Through the proposed OPF-for-ANM algorithm, the system-level control can dispatch fast diverse DER in different coordination approaches in a distributed manner.},

A major challenge in implementing microgrids is the communications and control to support transition from grid connected mode and operation in island mode. Here, we propose a secure communication architecture to support microgrid operation and control. A security model, including network, data, and attack models, is defined and a security protocol to address the real-time communication needs of microgrids is proposed. The implementation of the proposed security scheme is discussed and its performance evaluated using theoretical and co-simulation analysis, which shows it to be superior to existing protocols.},

In this paper, a two-step power flow model for such Induction Generators has been proposed. This model uses the solution of the quadratic equation to directly update the node voltage of the induction generator in the power flow problem. The proposed model does not neglect the core loss and magnetizing component of the steady state model of the Induction Generator. This model has been incorporated in Newton's method based load flow program for transmission systems and backward-forward sweep based radial distribution load flow program. It has been validated in a transmission system test case and a distribution system test case.

  abstract = {Microgrid usually associated with distributed renewable energy sources plays a key role in reducing the requirement of traditional power sources and the emission of CO2. Connecting multiple microgrids to the electric power grid can facilitate a more powerful and reliable operation. Microgrids need decentralized dispatch with the requirement of security and privacy, and at the same time, they need to cooperate to satisfy the constraints from the power grid. We consider online decentralized and cooperative dispatch problem in this paper. In order to capture the randomness in the wind and solar power generation and the system dynamics, we formulate the problem as a decentralized Markov decision process (Dec-MDP). We propose a new method to calculate the approximate Q-value functions by constructing the initial feasible policy with reasonable space and time complexity. Bayesian games (BGs) is applied to model the decentralized dispatch with delayed communication in order not to slow down the online decision-making. Also, the alternating minimization method is used to solve this BGs based on the approximate Q-value functions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is very effective in reducing the state space and computing time and achieving the requirement of real-time scheduling.},

  abstract = {The distribution system provides major opportunities for smart grid concepts. One way to approach distribution system problems is to rethinking our distribution system to include the integration of high levels of distributed energy resources, using microgrid concepts. Basic objectives are improved reliability, promote high penetration of renewable sources, dynamic islanding, and improved generation efficiencies through the use of waste heat. Managing significant levels of distributed energy resources (DERs) with a wide and dynamic set of resources and control points can become overwhelming. The best way to manage such a system is to break the distribution system down into small clusters or microgrids, with distributed optimizing controls coordinating multimicrogrids. The Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTSs) concept views clustered generation and associated loads as a grid resource or a Bmicrogrid.[ The clustered sources and loads can operate in parallel to the grid or as an island. This grid resource can disconnect from the utility during events (i.e., faults, voltage collapses), but may also intentionally disconnect when the quality of power from the grid falls below certain standards. This paper focuses on DER-based distribution, the basics of microgrids, possibility of smart distribution systems using coupled microgrid and the current state of autonomous microgrid technology.},

  abstract = {Traditional traveling wave protection schemes are susceptible to many factors such as network topology change, environment interference and inaccurate identification of wave fronts, which may lead to mal-operation of protection. In addition, most traveling wave protection schemes need accurate synchronous measurement which adds to the implementation cost. This paper proposes a traveling wave protection for high voltage power grids based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of zero-mode and aerial-mode traveling wave. First, the time difference of arrival of the modulus voltage traveling waves (MVTWs) asynchronously sampled at each bus is captured. With the minimum TDOA, the key bus and fault area can be firstly determined. Then, the TDOA of the line in per unit length is defined as the ratio between the difference of the TDOAs at both terminal buses and line length. Finally, as for one case that key bus connects with no other bus, the line corresponding to the minimum TDOA of all the lines in the fault area is determined as the fault line. As for the other case, the calculated line length should be compared with the actual one to detect the fault line. PSCAD/EMTDC is used to conduct fault simulations and the calculation results verify that the proposed scheme is not affected by fault resistances, inception angles and distances. In addition, the operation time of the scheme does not exceed 20ms, which makes it applicable for actual power grid protection.},

As more and more Internet of Things (IoT) devices with measurement and/or control capability are designed and deployed for a more stable and efficient power system, the role of communication network has become more important. To evaluate the performance of control algorithms for inter-dependent power grid and communication network, a test bed that could simulate inter-dependent power grid and communication network is desirable. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and implementation of a novel co-simulator, which would effectively evaluate IoT-aided algorithms for scheduling the jobs of electrical appliances. There are three major features of our co-simulator: 1) large-scale test is achieved by distributed modules that are designed based on a Turing-indistinguishable approach; 2) remote servers or test devices are controlled by local graphical user interface (we only need to configure the simulator on a local server); 3) a software virtual network approach is employed to emulate real networks, which significantly reduces the cost of real-world test beds. To evaluate our co-simulator, two energy consumption scheduling algorithms are implemented. Experimental results show that our co-simulator could effectively evaluate these methods. Thus our co-simulator is a powerful tool for utility companies and policy makers to commission novel IoT devices or methods in future smart grid infrastructure.},

Spanning tree search algorithms are applied to find the candidate restoration strategies by modeling microgrids as virtual feeders and representing the distribution system as a spanning tree. Unbalanced three-phase power flow is performed to ensure that the proposed system topology satisfies all operational constraints.

The notion that large power systems can achieve a higher level of resilience through the deployment of networked microgrids is discussed in detail. In particular, the management of networked microgrids for riding through extreme events is analyzed. In addition, the merits of advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs) in microgrid-based distributed systems that can support the power system resilience are presented.

As wide area measurements and control techniques are being developed and deployed for a more resilient power system, the role of communication network is becoming prominent. Power system dynamics gets influenced by the communication delays in the network. Therefore, extensive integration of power system and communication infrastructure mandates that the two systems be studied as a single distributed cyber-physical system. This paper proposes a power system and communication network co-simulation framework (GECO) using a global event-driven mechanism. The accuracy is tunable based on the time-scale requirements of the phenomena being studied.

  abstract = {An increased number of microgrids (MGs) will exist in future active distribution systems (ADSs); however, these MGs belong to multiple operators and cannot simply be controlled as a public grid in the electricity market environment. For multi-MGs (MMGs) which have multiple coexisting beneficiaries, it will be unfeasible to realize a cooperative control among them. Hence, we propose a game theoretic non-cooperative distributed coordination control (NCDCC) scheme to address multi-operator energy trading and facilitate a powerful control structure for MMGs. The proposed NCDCC coordinates the individual benefits of each MG and achieves a global objective based on differential game theory. Furthermore, it simplifies the implementation of many ADS control functions, including global coordination, local autonomy, and self-healing, by reconsidering an ADS as MMGs and every MG as an agent. Moreover, the NCDCC reduces the control dimension and number of agents by obviating the requirements for a central controller and complex communication topologies. This article investigates the effectiveness, adaptability, and fairness of this scheme by means of several representative cases studies.},

AC sources and loads are connected to the ac network whereas dc sources and loads are tied to the dc network. Energy storage systems can be connected to dc or ac links. The proposed hybrid grid can operate in a grid-tied or autonomous mode. The coordination control algorithms are proposed for smooth power transfer between ac and dc links and for stable system operation under various generation and load conditions. Uncertainty and intermittent characteristics of wind speed, solar irradiation level, ambient temperature, and load are also considered in system control and operation. A small hybrid grid has been modeled and simulated using the Simulink in the MATLAB.

  abstract = {As an islanded multi-microgrid (IMMG) receives little support from the main network, it is necessary to develop new dispatch frameworks to fulfil its real-time dispatch requirement. Hence, a decentralised collaborative dispatch framework of IMMG based on multi-agent consensus algorithm is proposed. In the framework, the ttal power command of IMMG can be optimally allocated among all the microgrids (MGs) based on consensus algorithm. Then the power command of each MG can be efficiently allocated among all the dispatchable units based on the proposed priority-based collaborative dispatch strategy. Based on the decentralised collaborative dispatch framework, in order to optimise the planning and operation of dispatchable active power resources (DAPRs), on one hand, a bi-level model that couples the planning and operation problems of an IMMG is established to optimise the configuration of DAPR; on the other hand, more detailed models are proposed for the regulation costs of various dispatchable units, which is an improvement over the existing regulation cost model. By considering the two aspects, the consensus algorithm is embedded in multiple population genetic algorithm to solve the bi-level model. Case studies are conducted on an IMMG consisting of three MGs to examine the effectiveness of the proposed planning and dispatch model.},

This brief studies the vulnerability analysis and recognition of key nodes in power grids from a complex network perspective. Based on the ac power flow model and the network topology weighted with admittance, the cascading failure model is established first. The node electrical centrality is further pointed out, using complex network centrality theory, to identify the key nodes in power grids. To effectively analyze the behavior and verify the correctness of node electrical centrality, the net-ability and vulnerability index are introduced to describe the transfer ability and performance under normal operation and assess the vulnerability of the power system under cascading failures, respectively. Simulation results of IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus test cases show that the key nodes can be effectively identified with high electrical centrality, the resultant cascading failures that eventually lead to a severe decrease in net-ability, verifying the correctness and effectiveness of the analysis.},

To assess the feasibility of P2P energy trading, where local electricity demand and supply balancing is desired, a so-called P2P index was developed. By clustering the historical smart metering data using the k-means method, customers were categorized by their electricity consumption patterns and representative demand profiles of low voltage electrical distribution networks were produced. A linear programming optimization was carried out to find the optimal capacity of different DERs to maximize the local demand and supply balancing. PV systems and combined heat and power units were considered as the renewable resources. This work provides network planners with guidelines of appropriate shares of DERs for better constructing their future networks, and facilitates a P2P energy trading market paradigm.},

In this paper, the OO load-flow modeling and algorithm are extended to account for the inclusion of DG.

The control algorithm is based on constraint satisfaction problem that is applied to solve the network constraint problem. The novelty of this control approach consists in the joint control of both distributed generation and demand response units for PFM in an autonomous regional control environment. The implementation of this demand-side management, integrated active network management, and distributed control technique contributes to network reinforcement deferral, economy of supply, and efficient capital expenditure. Simulation has been implemented in a medium voltage interconnected test network with a substation controller and a network simulator. The control actions successfully achieve the desired objectives and are evaluated in comparison analysis.

The objective is to improve productivity and participation of the players in the market that is composed of distributed energy resources (DER). The main goal of implementing a market structure based on TE is to secure permission for the market players so that they could attain a higher payoff. In this study, an optimization-based algorithm in which an objective function premised on economic strategies, distribution limitations and the overall demand in the market structure is proposed. The objective function is solved for near global optima using four heuristically guided optimization algorithms. The proposed algorithm which ensures that none of the independent players has priority and/or advantage over others, emphasizes optimum use of electrical/thermal energy distribution resources, while maximizing profit for the owners of the home microgrids (H-MGs). Reduction in the market clearing price (MCP) for further participation and the response of the consumers’ responsive loads are also considered in the study. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is validated in a coalition formation scenario among the existing H-MGs. Results show an increase in the profit attained, enhanced system reliability and a reduction in the electricity cost of the consumers.},

  abstract = {Microgrids (MGs), featured by distributed energy resources, consumption and storage, are designed to significantly enhance the self-sustainability of future electric distribution grids. In order to adapt to this new and revolutionary paradigm, it is necessary to control MGs in intelligent and coordinated fashion. To this aim, a new generation of advanced Microgrid Supervisory Controllers (MGSC) and Energy Management Systems (EMS) has emerged. The aim of this paper is to summarize the control objectives and development methodologies in the recently proposed MGSC/EMS. At first, a classification of control objectives is made according to the definition of hierarchical control layers in MGs. Then, focusing on MGSC/EMS related studies, a detailed methodology review is given with emphasis on representative applications and research works. Finally, the conclusions are summarized and the proposals of future research directions in this area are given.},

In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing smart grid operation with separable global costs and separable but nonconvex constraints, while considering important aspects of network operation, such as power flow and nodal voltage constraints. A localized primal dual method is applied through the use of an augmented Lagrange function, which is used to overcome the issues of nonconvexity in the presence of nonlinear equality constraints. The nonseparability of the augmented Lagrange penalty function is addressed through the use of local and neighborhood communication leading to a completely distributed solution of the global problem.},

New technologies are driving this transition, including photovoltaics, energy storage systems and electric vehicles. The integration and deployment of these technologies in the distribution network is having a positive impact on system efficiency. However, their behavior in the power system introduces technical challenges such as reverse power flow, voltage variation and other power quality issues. The integration of these technologies requires careful planning and operation to maintain or improve system stability and reliability. This work reviews the challenges imposed by deploying these low carbon technologies on low voltage systems. The main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: Firstly, it generally reviews the solution methodologies and power management strategies applied in the distribution network in the presence of low carbon technologies. Secondly, it outlines some important facts and statistics about their deployment. Finally, it discusses the energy evolution of the Northern Ireland network highlighting challenges and solutions and providing recommendations for future research.},

Smart meters are measurement devices that allow the operator to acquire accurate information about the end consumers, and state of the system. Smart meters provide the opportunity to revisit traditional distribution system models in an effort to improve them with more accurate information.

The proposed control strategy uses a convex formulation of the ac DOPF problem developed from a d-q reference frame voltage-current model and linear power flow approximations. The convex DOPF problem is divided between autonomous agents and solved based on local information and neighbour-to-neighbour communication over a sparse communication network, using a distributed primal subgradient algorithm. Each agent is only required to solve convex quadratic sub-problems, for which robust and efficient solvers exist, making the control strategy suitable for receding horizon model predictive control. Also, the agent sub-problems require limited power network information and include only a subset of the centralised optimisation problem decision variables and constraints, providing scalability and data privacy. Unlike existing distributed optimal power flow methods, such as alternating direction method of multipliers, under the proposed control strategy the information required by each agent is independent of the communication network topology, providing increased flexibility and robustness. The performance of the proposed control strategy was verified for an ac microgrid with distributed lead-acid batteries and intermittent photovoltaic generation, using an RTDS Technologies real-time digital simulator.},

Based on this concept, a hierarchical control strategy is developed for an AC microgrid with distributed battery and ultracapacitor energy storage systems. On the tertiary control level, the energy management problem is made scalable by considering each type of energy storage system in aggregate. This addresses the “curse of dimensionality,” since additional energy storage systems do not increase the optimization problem dimension, and allows nonlinear energy storage models to be used for optimization, accounting for variable efficiency, self-discharge, and lifetime degradation. On the secondary control level, multi-agent state of charge balancing, reactive power sharing, frequency restoration, and voltage restoration are combined, to aggregate energy storage systems for the tertiary control. This includes the novel use of multi-agent sliding mode control for state of charge balancing between AC microgrid energy storage systems.

  abstract = {Large-scale integration of renewable energies causes a higher degree of volatility and uncertainty of power flows in the electrical transmission system in Europe, and thus a higher risk of cascading line outages possibly leading to blackouts. At the same time, the transformation of the power system into a cyber-physical system deploying evolved information and communication technology (ICT) solutions offers the opportunity to meet this challenge efficiently by intelligent control approaches instead of ample security reserves. In this paper, a novelapproachfora distributedreal-time coordination of power flow control is presented. For this, a multiagent system located decentrally at the substation level has been developed only relying on local measurements and interagent communication in contrast to global systemmodelsandcentralizedcomputations.Basedonupdated information received from neighboring agents, the agents quickly adapt to changing network situations and relieve overloads by coordinated action of power flow controlling (PFC) devices. For smoothing control behavior and for avoiding excitation of system oscillations, the extent of control actions also adapts to the severity of the network situation. For two study cases—examining the control system in the IEEE 39-bus 10-machine reference system and a large-scale model of the Western European transmission system—the performance of the multiagent system and ICT requirements is evaluated based on a co-simulation of the multiagent system and an electromechanical power system simulation.},

The presented method provides a simple, easy to implement, and accurate approach to solve the power flow equations for microgrids.

  abstract = {In order to move towards a low carbon city, integration of renewable energy sources to the grid is the way forward. However, it decreases the system inertia and hence Energy Storage Systems (ESS) have to be used to provide frequency response in the Power System, for maintaining the frequency within the specified range. In a smart city, Demand Response can be utilized along with conventional ESS to provide the desired frequency response effectively and at a lower cost. In this paper, Demand Response of household refrigerators, in the twin city of Bhubaneswar-Cuttack, is combined with Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS). This combination is utilized as ancillary services for the Power System and it helps in lowering carbon emissions by acting as a replacement for fossil fuel generator based spinning reserve capacity. Case studies were undertaken to validate the effectiveness of this method to provide the required grid frequency response. Also, the economic benefits of this method were estimated and a potential saving of R 97 cr is expected.},

The local information of each BESS is exchanged with a few other neighboring BESSs to achieve a consensus. The consensus speed is significantly improved by introducing an inner control loop for energy levels. The droop frequency/voltage control is also added to regulate the active/reactive power sharing and the frequency/voltage of BESSs. Furthermore, self delays and communication delays are explicitly considered in the design. As a result, the derived consensus algorithms are fully distributed with fast consensus speed in both contexts of nonexistence and existence of time delays, which have not been addressed in the existing research for BESSs. To validate the design, several simulation case studies are carried out.},

When the communication graph among agents is connected, a novel parallel and distributed consensus-based algorithm is proposed to derive an RTP scheme to facilitate DR, and when communication uncertainties exist, a robust consensus algorithm is proposed to cease the effect of uncertainties. Next, this paper proposes a novel control mechanism to tackle the problem of disconnected communication among agents, e.g., under cyber-attacks, by employing the so-called mixed communication-broadcast control architecture where the underlying ideas are twofold. First, each area in the grid associated with a connected subgraph is controlled by a MAS to guarantee the power balance and to reach consensus on the local electric price for that area. Second, a supervisory unit observes those local electric prices to calculate the global electric price for the whole grid and then broadcasts to all units so that they can properly adjust their output powers. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system to validate the proposed control mechanisms.},

The economic operation of MMGs is formulated as an optimization problem. A stochastically and probabilistic modeling of both small-scale energy resources (SSERs) and load demand at each microgrids (MGs) is done to determine the optimal economic operation of each MGs with minimum cost based on the power transaction between the MGs and main grids. The balance between the total power generation in each MGs and the load demand is determined regarding the sold or purchase power either by MG or by main grid. Based on the results, the mean, standard deviation, and probability density function of each generated power with SSERs is determined considering optimization constraints. A statistical analysis for generated power and costs is given. The power interchange between MGs is considered. The particle swarm optimization is applied to minimize the cost function as an optimization algorithm. Results show that it is possible to regulate the power demand and power transaction between each MGs and the main grid. Moreover, it is indicated that the power sharing between MGs with main grid can reduce the total operation cost of the future distribution network.},

In this evolving paradigm, designing energy management strategies for feasible and cost-effective utilisation of V2G is one of the several challenges faced by the utility operators and regulators. This paper proposes two energy management strategies to effectively utilize V2G potential of PEVs in managing energy imbalances in grid-connected microgrids. The contributions of this paper are in twofold. First, it proposes a novel bidding strategy for PEVs offering V2G by including the projected battery degradation cost to integrate them into microgrid operation. Second, two energy management strategies are proposed for inclusion of V2G into the microgrid operation based on the forecast accuracy on energy supply and demand, and market prices. The proposed V2G integration strategies are implemented using a multi-agent system developed in Java agent development framework and applied to a microgrid case study system. The simulation results and their analysis show that V2G can be used to maximum depth of discharge levels if the electricity price variation is high and battery cost of PEVs is low.},

The proposed two-stage load restoration technique is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization problem with the sole objective of optimally restoring the maximum number of disconnected loads. The proposed technique is applied to a distribution system comprising of several microgrids, i.e., Multi-Microgrid (MMG) distribution system. In this proposed technique, the power transactions between individual microgrids are managed through (1) determining the schedule of local energy resources, and (2) by obtaining the control signals pertaining to local flexible loads. Flexible load control signals are prioritized through two incorporated Demand Response (DR) programs, namely emergency load shedding and preemptive load shifting. To quantify the restoration technique performance, a new index—denoted as restoration technique success index (SI)—is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed restoration technique is verified through different test case scenarios and the obtained results are discussed.},

  abstract = {Global humanitarian initiatives are calling for technologies to bridge the urban-rural divide in support of remote community electrification projects through micro-utility programs. Distributed off-grid renewable generation has the ability to supply energy to remote communities while smart microgrids are able to effectively integrate intermittent renewable resources through management procedures that improve reliability, resiliency and sustainability. Microgrid control systems are typified by a hierarchical nature with multi-layered functionalities and capabilities to ensure optimized operations through strategic energy management and power flow balancing. This paper considers transactive energy management principles for supply/demand coordination and demonstrates that the concept is effective in managing energy demand response and data flow dynamics in the context of rural community-based energy systems. A transactive energy management system is modeled for rural village DC microgrids, and evaluated through demonstrative computer simulations. It shows how smart microgrid load control switching on homogeneous load groups is commanded through microgrid economic value signals that are adjustable by home owners to meet village and household energy budget constraints. The proposed approach is novel in that it offers a low complexity coordination framework, based on market principles, and demand response mechanisms for multi-priority grouping control of non-intelligent devices in offgrid rural village settings.},

  abstract = {This paper applies a new technique for modal decomposition based solely on measurements to test systems and demonstrates the technique's capability for partitioning a power network, which determines the points of separation in an islanding strategy. The mathematical technique is called the Koopman mode analysis (KMA) and stems from a spectral analysis of the so-called Koopman operator. Here, KMA is numerically approximated by applying an Arnoldi-like algorithm recently first applied to power system dynamics. In this paper we propose a practical data-driven algorithm incorporating KMA for network partitioning. Comparisons are made with two techniques previously applied for the network partitioning: spectral graph theory which is based on the eigenstructure of the graph Laplacian, and slow-coherency which identifies coherent groups of generators for a specified number of low-frequency modes. The partitioning results share common features with results obtained with graph theory and slow-coherency-based techniques. The suggested partitioning method is evaluated with two test systems, and similarities between Koopman modes and Laplacian eigenvectors are showed numerically and elaborated theoretically.},

  abstract = {In this study, a robust and dynamic transactive energy system in smart grid (SG) environment is proposed based on the Tsypkin–Polyak theorem. A key factor of the proposed system is to consider the uncertainties in electrical grid parameters. Moreover, oligopolistic behaviours of agents, i.e. demands and generating units, are considered in the modelling. It is proved that selfish agents offer their true cost parameters in the proposed transactive energy system. Therefore, optimal power flow (OPF) of the electrical grid is obtained in the proposed transactive energy system. In addition, real-time locational marginal prices (LMPs) are also presented for demand-side management (DSM). Hence, all levels of demands side can interact and communicate with generation side through real-time LMPs. This characteristic is known as interoperability of transactive energy systems. However, in addition to all benefits of the proposed system, it has adverse impacts on the stability of the electrical grid. Here, to solve this challenge, a hierarchical and robust control system is proposed by using the Tsypkin–Polyak theorem to control stability and OPF simultaneously. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed system is validated by implementing it on a test electrical grid.},

In the carbon capture power plant, CO2 emitted by generating units can be recycled and used in the energy conversion process of power to gas. Thus, the efficient utilization of CO2 can be realized. In view of the serious phenomenon of wind abandonment and high CO2 emissions, a low-carbon economic dispatching model of the integrated energy system based on power to gas and carbon capture power plants is proposed, which takes the power to gas and carbon capture power plants as a whole. The modified IEEE39-bus power network and Belgium 20-bus natural gas network are used for the example analysis. By comparing and analyzing the abandoned wind power, carbon capture capacity and the integrated operation cost of the system under the two models, it is verified that the model can improve the carbon utilization rate, enhance the ability of wind power accommodation, and reduce CO2 emissions and integrated operation cost.},

Several tools like modal analysis, the discrete wavelet transform and a probabilistic neural network trained to work with the energy contained in the wavelet transform coefficients are applied to analyze the high frequency pattern generated during the fault. The proposed algorithm is capable of detecting, locating and classifying faults in a reliable way. The impact of harmonic frequencies generated by the TCSC in the protection algorithm was also analyzed. Several studies were carried out in order to validate and to assess the effect of several fault parameters on the algorithm accuracy. The obtained results show that for a sampling rate of 100kHz, the algorithm error in calculating the distance to the fault is less than one percent of the total transmission line length. A higher sampling rate improves the algorithm accuracy.},

The approach is validated using IEEE 123-bus test systems with both cyber and physical layers simulated using a co-simulation platform.

The approach is validated using IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node test systems and is shown to converge to the same optimal solution as obtained using an equivalent centralized OPF (C-OPF) model.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new transactive energy (TE) scheme to determine energy trading strategies among transactive market participants in a transactive environment. In our proposed approach, distribution systems operator (DSO) generates distribution locational marginal price (DLMP) for transactive nodes (TNs). Then, TNs calculate transactive incentive signal (TIS) and transactive feedback signal (TFS), and send them back to the DSO as feedback signals. In the case that a TN has surplus energy to sell to its neighboring node, it will update TIS for its neighboring TN. If the updated TIS is less than the DLMP, which is determined by the DSO for a potential buyer, energy transaction will be performed. In this paper, only photovoltaic (PV) is considered as renewable energy resource (RES) and simulation results are carried out for a planning period of 30 years that is an expected lifetime of the PV arrays. In our proposed TE approach, all transactive market participants have their own benefits, and net benefits for DSO and all transactive market participants are analyzed. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed TE approach, a 9-bus test system is considered as the case study.},

To overcome preceding drawbacks, a novel power-voltage control strategy, based on the voltage feedback control of the inverter LCL filter capacitor, is proposed in this paper. A dynamic model of the inverter output impedance is developed in the rotating d-q frame. This model includes main circuit parameters, phase-locked loop (PLL) dynamics, and regulator parameters. Frequency characteristics of the output impedance, contrastive analysis between the conventional power-current strategy and proposed power-voltage strategy based on generalized Nyquist criterion are presented to show superiority of the latter in a weak grid. The impedance analysis proves the power-voltage controlled inverter can stably operate in a weak grid. The stability of the grid-tied inverter system remains unchanged with increasing PLL bandwidth and delivered power, thereby effectively raising the rated power injection level of the inverter in a weak grid. A low-power inverter prototype is built and tested in the laboratory. The simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Transmission and Distribution (T \&D) co-simulation is an effective tool to accurately consider the DERs and account for the changing power grid for various power system planning and operational studies. We have developed a T\&D co-simulation framework with commercial transmission system solvers like PSS/E that can handle largescale transmission networks, and accurate distribution system solver (GridLAB-D) that can model the distribution systems down to the house level and behind-the-meter DERs. PSS/E and GridLAB-D are combined using HELICS environment and are driven using Python to enable multi-timescale T\&D co-simulation. This framework is scalable and parallel computing compatible that will enable large-scale system simulations. This framework will enable adoption of T\&D co-simulation methodology by the industry and utilities. The scalable multi-timescale T\&D co-simulation framework will be instrumental to enable faster integration of DERs by making the various planning and operational studies more accurate.},

  abstract = {Electric distribution systems around the world are seeing an increasing number of utility-owned and non-utility-owned (customer-owned) intelligent devices and systems being deployed. New deployments of utility-owned assets include self-healing systems, microgrids, and distribution automation. Non-utilityowned assets include solar photovoltaic generation, behind-the-meter energy storage systems, and electric vehicles. While these deployments provide potential data and control points, the existing centralized control architectures do not have the flexibility or the scalability to integrate the increasing number or variety of devices. The communication bandwidth, latency, and the scalability of a centralized control architecture limit the ability of these new devices and systems from being engaged as active resources. This paper presents a standards-based architecture for the distributed power system controls, which increases operational flexibility by coordinating centralized and distributed control systems. The system actively engages utility and non-utility assets using a distributed architecture to increase reliability during normal operations and resiliency during extreme events. Results from laboratory testing and preliminary field implementations, as well as the details of an ongoing full-scale implementation at Duke Energy, are presented.},

  abstract = {Regulated electricity utilities are required to provide safe and reliable service to their customers at a reasonable cost. To balance the objectives of reliable service and reasonable cost, utilities build and operate their systems to operate under typical historic conditions. As a result, when abnormal events such as major storms or disasters occur, it is not uncommon to have extensive interruptions in service to the end-use customers. Because it is not cost effective to make the existing electrical infrastructure 100\% reliable, society has come to expect disruptions during abnormal events. However, with the increasing number of abnormal weather events, the public is becoming less tolerant of these disruptions. One possible solution is to deploy microgrids as part of a coordinated resiliency plan to minimize the interruption of power to essential loads. This paper evaluates the feasibility of using microgrids as a resiliency resource, including their possible benefits and the associated technical challenges.

A distributed networked control system is used in order to implement a distributed secondary control (DSC), thus avoiding its implementation in MGCC. The proposed approach is not only able to restore frequency and voltage of the MG but also ensures reactive power sharing. The distributed secondary control does not rely on a central control, so that the failure of a single unit will not produce the fail down of the whole system. Experimental results are presented to show the feasibility of the DSC. The time latency and data drop-out limits of the communication systems are studied as well.},

First, a fuzzy logic-based information deviation detection scheme is proposed for detection of the effects of cyber-attacks on the information. Two distributed control schemes, based on leader-follower distributed control schemes, are proposed to decide the power exchange by DESS under cyber-attack scenarios. A consensus-based leader-follower distributed control scheme under cyber-attacks, with an arbitrary topology, is proposed while incorporating information deviation detection scheme. Furthermore, a novel agent-based secure distributed optimal control scheme is proposed for charging and discharging of distributed energy storage systems. Linear quadratic regulator-based distributed optimal control scheme is incorporated in this scheme. In both proposed control schemes, the information deviation of agents is monitored and, based on their information deviations, the control actions are taken to ensure agents' information convergence. The electricity consumption data of a practical medium-voltage distribution system is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes. Both control schemes are demonstrated to ensure peak shaving operations in the power distribution system, which may consist of an unreliable communication network, by DESSs.},

Firstly, since the co-simulation is an effective method to investigate infrastructure interdependencies, the co-simulation platform establishment of CPEES and its evaluation is overviewed. Then, a critical problem of CPEES is the interaction between energy and information flow, especially the influence of failures happening in information communication technology (ICT) on power system. In order to figure it out, the interaction is analyzed and the current analysis methods are summarized. For the solution of power system control and protection in information network environment, this paper outlines different control principles and illustrates the concept of distributed coordination control. Moreover, mass data processing and cluster analysis, architecture of communication network, information transmission technology and security of CPEES are summarized and analyzed. By solving the above problems and technologies, the development of CPEES will be significantly promoted.},

  abstract = {Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are being integrated into the power market by customers rather than large scale energy suppliers, thereby slowly transforming the centralized, unidirectional market to a decentralized, bidirectional market and transitioning customers into prosumers. Various system architectures are used in the real field to coordinate the energy distribution in the micro/ mini-grids integrated with DERs, all of which have their strengths, weaknesses and challenges. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is an emerging architecture in the field of electrical energy trading and Distributed Generation (DG) management that can be applied in local energy markets. This paper focuses on P2P energy trading, with an in-depth discussion on its various operating algorithms, their principles, characteristics, features and scope through state of art review on P2P. Furthermore, the energy system of Nepal is used as a case study in this paper, and the micro/mini-grids of Nepal and their associated challenges, constraints and opportunities for improvement are discussed. Finally, an energy trading model is proposed to address the problems occurring in the specific case of Nepalese energy market.},

  abstract = {The use of distributed computation and control is pervasive for a wide range of smart grid research topics. However, recent developments of smart grid co-simulation platforms have not been able to provide effective support for the modeling and simulation of distributed software systems. In particular, cosimulation literatures only focused on the integration of electrical and communication network simulators, and the responsibility for modeling distributed software is often delegated to one of these two simulators. Since these domain specific simulators are not designed for this purpose, such delegation incurs many limitations that prevent convenient, effective, and accurate modeling of software behaviors. To mitigate the problem, this paper presents, to our knowledge, the first co-simulation integration of direct-execution simulators to provide dedicated support for distributed smart grid software. We first present the development of the novel DecompositionJ framework (DEterministic, COncurrent Multi-PrOcessing SImulaTION for Java programs), which is a compiler-based code analyzer and transformer to automatically convert multi-thread Java programs into direct-execution simulators, eliminating the need for manual code or model development. Next, we apply DecompositionJ framework to generate simulators for a popular multi-agent platform JADE. The JADE simulators are then integrated with electromagnetic transient simulator (PSCAD) and packet-level network simulator (OPNET) using standardized co-simulation runtime infrastructure. At last, we conduct a case study on agent-based smart grid restoration using this novel co-simulation platform. Through the analysis of simulation results, it is shown that the proposed direct-execution simulation framework is able to facilitate the understanding, evaluation, and debugging of distributed smart grid software.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present new distributed controllers for secondary frequency and voltage control in islanded microgrids. Inspired by techniques from cooperative control, the proposed controllers use localized information and nearest-neighbor communication to collectively perform secondary control actions. The frequency controller rapidly regulates the microgrid frequency to its nominal value while maintaining active power sharing among the distributed generators. Tuning of the voltage controller provides a simple and intuitive tradeoff between the conflicting goals of voltage regulation and reactive power sharing. Our designs require no knowledge of the microgrid topology, impedances, or loads. The distributed architecture allows for flexibility and redundancy, eliminating the need for a central microgrid controller. We provide a voltage stability analysis and present extensive experimental results validating our designs, verifying robust performance under communication failure and during plug-and-play operation.},

The traditional unit commitment problem aims at minimizing the cost of operation subject to fulfillment of demand. However in a deregulated environment the traditional unit commitment objective needs to be changed to maximization of profit with relaxation of the demand fulfillment constraint. This paper applies a genetic algorithm technique to price based unit commitment (PBUC) for GENCO with 3 generators and compares the solution with that obtained by dynamic programming.

The proposed EMS models are mixed integer quadratic programming problems, requiring less computation time and thus suitable for online applications. The practical EMS models are compared with a typical decoupled unit commitment and optimal power flow-based EMS with and without consideration of system unbalancing. The models, along with “standard” EMS models, are tested, validated, and compared using a CIGRE medium voltage benchmark system and the real isolated microgrid of Kasabonika Lake First Nation in Northern Ontario, Canada.

The cyber and power systems together form a complex structure, which is referred to as a cyber–physical system (CPS). If the power system's observability and controllability are compromised due to communication and cyber security problems, the grid can be exposed to catastrophic events. As a result, there is a great need to model the interactions between ICT and power grids. This paper proposes a new model and simulation platform for the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system of an integrated CPS. SCADA performance is assessed based on communication time delays. Methods to model cyber intrusions and assess the CPS security are proposed. The success rates for unauthorized access and control of power devices are computed. The impact on the grid is evaluated and the attack with the highest efficiency is identified. The proposed method is tested with the IEEE 39-bus system on a SCADA testbed. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

These challenges range from technical constraint violations, such as: overloads on feeders, over- or under- voltages in network nodes, and reverse power flows, to inaccurate operational planning due to uncertain production of renewable resources. However, recent advances in specialized software packages for active management of DERs could turn these challenges into the operational and monetary benefits for both distribution utilities, as well as end customers. Hence, if managed and operated in an optimal way, DERs could be highly-valuable resources for increasing efficiency of the overall management of distribution grids, as well as for providing much-needed flexibility in the operation of today's active systems. Utility Distribution Energy Resource Management Systems (Utility DERMS) aims to offer all these capabilities integrated in a single software package.

  abstract = {The integration of computing and communication capabilities with the power grid has led to numerous vulnerabilities in the cyber-physical system (CPS). This cyber security threat can significantly impact the physical infrastructure, economy, and society. In traditional IT environments, there are already abundant attack cases demonstrating that unauthorized users have the capability to access and manipulate sensitive data from a protected network domain. Electric power grids have also heavily adopted information technology (IT) to perform real-time control, monitoring, and maintenance tasks. In 2015, a sophisticated cyber attack targeted Ukrainian’s power grid causing wide area power outages. It highlights the importance of investment on cyber security against intruders. This paper provides a state-of-the-art survey of the most relevant cyber security studies in power systems. It reviews research that demonstrates cyber security risks and constructs solutions to enhance the security of a power grid. To achieve this goal, this paper covers: (1) a survey of the state-of-the-art smart grid technologies, (2) power industry practices and standards, (3) solutions that address cyber security issues, (4) a review of existing CPS testbeds for cyber security research, and (5) unsolved cyber security problems. Power grid cyber security research has been conducted at Washington State University (WSU) with a hardware-in-a-loop CPS testbed. A demonstration is provided to show how the proposed defense systems can be deployed to protect a power grid against cyber intruders.},

The model's parameters can easily be extracted from the manufacturer's discharge curve, which allows for an easy use of the model. A method is described to extract the model's parameters and to approximate the internal resistance. The model is validated by superimposing the results with the manufacturer's discharge curves. Finally, the battery model is included in the SimPowerSystems (SPS) simulation software and is used in the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) demo.

  abstract = {Synchronous generators and inverter-based resources are complex systems with dynamics that cut across multiple intertwined physical domains and control loops. Modeling individual generators and inverters is, in itself, a very involved activity and has attracted dedicated attention from power engineers and control theorists over the years. Control and stability challenges associated with increasing penetration of grid-following inverters have generated tremendous interest in grid-forming inverter technology. The envisioned coexistence of inverter technologies alongside rotating machines call for modeling frameworks that can accurately describe networked dynamics of interconnected generators and inverters across timescales. We put forth a comprehensive integrated system model for such a setting by: i) adopting a combination of circuit- and systemtheoretic constructs, ii) unifying representations of three-phase signals across reference-frame transformations and phasor types, and iii) leveraging domain-level knowledge, engineering insights, and reasonable approximations. A running theme through our effort is to offer a clear distinction between physics-based models and the task of modeling. Among several insights spanning the spectrum from analytical to practical, we highlight how differential-algebraic-equation models and algebraic power-flow phasor models fall out of the detailed originating electromagnetic transient models.},

A new class of monitoring and control applications are made possible with the PMUs. Although PMU based monitoring systems have been well developed, implementations of PMU based fast acting closed loop wide area control systems are relatively rare. To meet the stringent latency requirements of a wide area controller the communication and power infrastructures have to collaborate strongly. In this paper, a combined process for design and simulation of both communication network and power network has been presented with the objective of damping interarea oscillations. A method to determine the optimal location of data routing hubs so as to minimize the volume of communications is also proposed. The IEEE 118 bus system is used to study the performance of communication system and the wide area power damping control system on both centralized and decentralized topologies, and the results are discussed. One of the conclusions of the paper is that the decentralized communication architectures involving data routing hubs are better suited for control applications requiring fast control actions.},

The security, reliability and economy of a microgrid physical system depend on the accurate and efficient operation of the cyber system which is compatible with it. Malicious attacks, channel interruptions and other faults on cyber side may lead to operational risks on physical side. Quantifying the impact of cyber failures helps to improve the energy management system and operation optimization algorithm. With the development of microgrids and the increase of the penetration rate of new energy in the power grid, distributed optimization control is gradually emerging. Therefore, it is of great significance to analyze the process of cyber-physical interaction in distributed control systems. In this paper, we construct cyber topology for distributed control micro grid and establish its CPS model and channel fault model.

PV inverters can curtail active power or consume reactive power to avoid these excessive high voltages. Local controllers of active and reactive power that are based on measurements of the produced PV power have a fast response to the changing production levels of the PV installation. The performance of these local controllers depends on the tuning of the control parameters, which are grid and time dependent. In this paper, local control functions are defined as piecewise linear functions. The parameters of all the local control functions are regularly reoptimized. This results in an optimal use of reactive power and a minimum amount of curtailed active power, while respecting network limitations. The optimization of these parameters is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can be solved sufficiently fast. The performance of the control is evaluated on an existing three-phase four-wire distribution grid and is compared with different local control methods.},

Attractive aspects about the approach include strong scalability characteristics, simplified interfaces between automation devices, and the adaptability to integrate a wide variety of devices and systems. Experience in this nascent field is revealing a rich array of engineering decisions to consider along with the application of complexity theory. To test the decisions, computer simulations are used to reveal insights about design, demand elasticity, and the limits of response (including consumer fatigue).

This work proposes an optimal secondary control with non-iterative power flow to regulate multi-bus voltages and DERs’ reactive powers. The control scheme incorporates a modified Decoupled Linearized Power Flow that is known to be superior in terms of reactive power and bus voltage magnitude estimation, as compared to classical DC power flow, into a constrained quadratic programming. Q-V droop is integrated into the linear power flow in place of the slack bus. The proposed optimal scheme is provably accurate for maintaining reactive power sharing while regulating multiple load-bus voltages. The additional degrees of freedom enabled by the weighting factors significantly improve the control flexibility of the secondary controller. The allowable bus voltages and DER kVar capacity limits have also been considered by the control algorithm. The work is proven through an accurate co-simulation study comprising an 18-bus network and a full primary control models in PowerFactory, interfaced through industrial communication tool MatrikonOPC.},

Based on the autonomous control model of each single microgrid, coordinated information and strategies among different microgrids are used to decrease the operating cost of distributed generation, improve the efficiency of the distributed storages utilization, and reduce the complexity of distribution network operation. The optimal control problem of microgrids is modeled as a decentralized partially-observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP), and a coordinated dynamic programming algorithm is used to solve the problem by introducing a look-head dual multiplier mechanism as decentralized control signals from centralized information. The performances of this algorithm and the impacts of different coordinated information are discussed by some study cases in the end of this paper.},

In a microgrid, the secondary control is implemented in order to eliminate the frequency changes caused by the primary control when coordinating renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. Nevertheless, the conventional decentralized secondary control, although does not need to be implemented in a microgrid central controller (MGCC), it has the limitation that all decentralized controllers must be mutually synchronized. In a clear cut contrast, the proposed secondary control requires only a more simplified communication protocol and a sparse communication network. Moreover, the proposed approach based on dynamic consensus algorithms is able to achieve the coordinated secondary performance even when all units are initially out-ofsynchronism. The control algorithm implemented in an islanded microgrid system is tested in different scenarios by means of hardware-in-the-loop results.},

  abstract = {Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are being widely installed in the transmission grid. Many power system applications based on PMUs have been developed or are under development in academia and industry. For those applications, data latency is often a critical factor that affects their performance thus making the topology of the communication network that exchanges real-time data between the control center (CC) and substations (SS) of vital importance. This paper introduces a method to conceptualize and analyze possible communication topologies by simulating them in Network Simulator 3 (NS3). Moreover, a new algorithm is developed to optimize the clustering of substations in such a way that the data latency performance of the decentralized communication topology can meet the requirements for PMU based applications. To validate the proposed methodology, the IEEE 118-bus system is used as the test case. A PMU based wide-area controller for transient stability is simulated in the MATLAB Simulink to validate the proposed communication topologies. It is concluded from the simulation results that the decentralized communication topology at a lower cost designed by optimizing the substation cluster boundaries can be an alternative choice and can help PMU based applications achieve good performance by limiting data latency to an acceptable level. Also, this paper can provide a technical guidance for power utilities choosing the most appropriate communication network for the PMU based real-time applications.},

  abstract = {An ultra high voltage (UHV) ac and dc interconnection will become the foundation of China’s future smart grid. Due to the wide spread of interconnected regions, the distance between control stations will increase dramatically. Therefore, the communication system’s reliability and real-time performance will become increasingly crucial. However, failures of the communication system, such as interruptions, latency, and bit error, are inevitable. This paper uses the UHV grid security and stability defense system (SSDS) as an example to analyze its requirements for communication and the impact of communication failure on the system’s performance. The effect of communication latency on the power system’s stability is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Based on this analysis, a framework of an UHV grid SSDS considering the risk of the communication system is proposed. A preliminary power system and communication system co-simulation tool is developed to perform a case study. The case study demonstrates that communication latency in the UHV grid changes the control strategy’s effectiveness due to a delay in executing the control strategy. Furthermore, communication latency will negatively affect the power grid’s stability.},

Then the ineffective arrival time of initial traveling wave is eliminated and modified, while the effective arrival time of initial traveling wave is utilized to detect the fault line. Different from the traditional protection schemes, which are only based on fault information of one line, the proposed scheme not only solves the problems of traveling wave protection, which are susceptible to the factors (such as the structure of the lines), but also can make reliable tripping action when one or more TWPRs break down, start-up failure or record wrong arrival time of initial traveling wave. Both theoretical analysis and simulations indicate that the protection method has high reliability, and redounds to further enhancing the practicability of traveling wave protection.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel distributed multi-agent finite-time control strategy with time delays for the state of charge balancing and voltage restoration in a dc microgrid with distributed battery energy storage systems. The delays can be different and theoretically unbounded for each battery system. Feedback linearization method is applied to convert the state of charge balancing and voltage restoration problems to double-integrator and single-integrator systems with input time delays, respectively. Then, the Artstein transformation is applied to reduce the time delayed systems to delay-free systems. Based on the reduced models, the finite-time control is modified to achieve the state of charge balancing and voltage restoration. Only the state of charge and its derivative and voltage information are required to be transmitted over a sparse communication network to generate the control signals. The finite-time Lyapunov method ensures accurate convergence and finite-time stability. The proposed secondary control strategy can be integrated with conventional primary droop control.

  abstract = {Since high-penetration renewable sources are integrated into the future power system, energy storage systems are often installed to maintain the frequency stability in a microgrid. The operation mode of a microgrid may frequently change due to the intermittency of renewable sources, and energy storage systems will be charged/discharged accordingly to smooth and balance the generation of renewable sources. Thus, energy storage systems should be coordinated in a proper approach to ensure the supply-demand balance while increasing their profits and energy efficiency. To this end, a distributed optimal solution for energy storage systems to maintain the supply-demand balance while maximizing their welfare and energy efficiency is proposed to energy storage systems by enhancing the coordination through the communication under a multiagent system framework. Under this framework, each energy storage system is designated as an agent, and it only utilizes the local information to interact with the neighbouring agents. Additionally, since the participants in a microgrid may not be willing to release their information about cost functions, or even the local gradient with other neighbouring agents, the proposed solution could be implemented without these private information to the individual agents. The simulation studies are carried out for IEEE 14-bus and 30-BESS systems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed solution.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of microgrid (MG) has made it ready to connect multiple MGs for providing regional power supply. The energy management of a multi-MG (MMG) system is the key to the reliable, economic operation of the interconnected power system. The MMG system is rich in distributed generation sources. The intermittence and volatility of renewable energy sources (RESs), such as wind and solar, cannot be ignored in a large-scale hybrid power system. Therefore, the energy management of a MMG system is a complex problem that coordinates distributed generation units within individual MGs, the power exchange among MGs, and the power trading between the grid and MGs. System of systems (SoS) has been identified as an effective way of forming a MMG system and coordinating the participating MGs for energy management. This paper proposes a hierarchical decentralized SoS architecture for the energy management of a MMG system and, accordingly, formulates it as a bilevel optimization problem. Energy management at the level of individual MGs is modeled as a multiple-stage robust optimization to handle the issue of RES uncertainty. Energy management at the level of MMG system further addresses the problem of spatially unbalanced demand and generation in the area. The proposed MMG energy management is further verified through a case study.},

  abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) with dynamic boundaries provide an alternative solution to serve distribution systems without energization from the utility. Adopting the concept of dynamic MGs enables a flexible operation of service restoration toward resilient distribution networks by changing system topology through smart switches and conventional circuit breakers. This work proposes a novel restoration framework including three control phases including initial, restorative and corrective actions for the distribution network (DN) with full utilization of the flexibility of distributed generators in various operational modes. Comparing with existing works that only consider MGs as a constant negative load and ignore the dynamics of different components within MGs, each MG is equipped with a model predictive control (MPC)-based controller that is responsible for optimally scheduling available power to the DN based on its local generation and load demand. Aided by the MPC framework, in this article, the conventional restoration strategy is extended that further includes the operational dynamic behavior of MGs during restoration process guaranteeing a more flexible and reliable operation. Several numerical cases are studied using the IEEE 8500-node test system to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed framework.},

In order to address this problem, a voltage collapse monitoring and predicting framework is proposed. The power system dynamics is modeled by stochastic differential equations, which is closer to the real-world power systems. Rigorous derivation has proven that as the system approaches the collapse point, external stochastic fluctuations become dominant and the variance of state variable deviation increases monotonically. An approximate linearization method to compute the variance is presented. The scaling law between the variance and the distance to the collapse is also presented, which makes it possible to predict the transition point in advance. The numerical simulations on three power system models have validated the proposed method.},

In no area is this truer than with Demand Response (DR) programs for the commercial building sector, which is responsible for 20 percent of energy demand and emissions in the United States. These concentrated pools of demand are a nightmare for ever-more strained utility grids, especially in major cities. As a result, utilities have created DR programs to provide financial incentives for building owners to reduce energy consumption during peak periods. This paper explores what these programs currently entail and why they are not working. It then presents and discusses an alternative that can break the major barriers to adoption of the Smart Grid - moving from a manual to the Optimized Demand Response system.},

  abstract = {An interconnected multi-microgrids (IMMGs) system takes advantage of various complementary power sources and effectively coordinates the energy sharing/trading among the MGs and the main grid to improve the stability, reliability, and energy efficiency of the system. The core of this structure is to achieve the optimal distribution of energy sharing through proper strategies. However, the volatility and intermittent characteristics of renewable resources, time-varying loads in the MGs, their correlated power generations, and the coupled energy among the MGs during energy trading, all bring about new challenges to achieving a stable operation and optimal scheduling in the power system. Many solutions have been proposed to solve these problems. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current energy management systems (EMS) in IMMGs, focusing on the IMMG structure, EMS objectives, timescales, and scheduling optimization structure. We then provide a review of the distributed optimization algorithms in IMMGs. We conclude this survey with a discussion of future directions.},
